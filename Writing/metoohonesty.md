When I was 4 years old, I carved my brother's name into a wooden table that my father had built.
The table had a chess board inlaid, alternating with light and dark stain, and a removable tabletop for storage of the game pieces.
I don't remember what instrument I used to carve the 2 inch letters spelling "BILL."
My parents immediately asked me who defaced my father's project.
I'm told that I quickly blamed Bill, acting as though the answer was self evident.
Bill is my younger brother, and he was still crawling at the time.
As first born, I may have been feeling neglected with a new baby in the house.  
How did a 4 year old come up with the idea for this deception?
My parents are not habitual liars nor they did not teach this behavior.
My exposure to the outside world was fairly limited, and I doubt that Sesame Street was preaching deception as a winning strategy.

The answer has to be in genetics.  
Over the past 5 million years, we became the ultra-social primate.
Chimpanzees are on the other branch that retained their large canine teeth and patterns of overt male aggression.
While they are capable of co-operation, we default to it.
More than any other trait, the collective hardwiring separates us from other primates.
There is nothing more expressive of this human quality than passing an infant to a new acquaintance.

To give context, only 8 thousands years ago did people developed the gene to allow adults to drink milk.

That does not mean that competition between people evaporated.  
I will not be perpetuating the myth of the noble savage.
But it did change into something we would easily recognize.
In a collective, deception and manipulation can be used to further an individual's interest without disrupting society.  

Secret acts of infidelity seem the most direct evolutionary route.  
Perpetrated by both men and women.
The other obvious path is calories.
In a hunter gather society food was pooled.  
Eating in secret would probably be equally tempting as taboo.

While its true that humans sometimes will lock horns in outright combat, this is not as common as simply jockeying for position within a society.  
 And murder was a leading cause of death, though it was rarely the domestic occurrence it has become in modern society.   
When we lived in small clans, killing was common when confronted by an outsider, often out of revenge.  
But killing within the group would be less tolerated and risked swift expulsion or death.  


This deceitfulness was not good for the collective, so the groups that could ferret out the worst liars were more likely to survive.

The theory is that an evolutionary arms race began between the people who lie and people who can detect lying.
As this match played out over centuries, pitting the deceitful against those with and acute olfactory sense for bullshit, a simple winning strategy appeared:
Honesty.
And this is evolutionary backbone of morality.
It's how humanity shares morality without sharing religion.
Religion started as a way to explain nature; earthquakes, lightning, and fire.
Only later did the religions that incorporated morality supersede the primitive cults.
To quote the aptly titled Kayne song, "No Church in the Wild."
    We formed a new religion
    No sins as long as there's permission
    And deception is the only felony
    So never fuck nobody without tellin' me

My theory is that in every fundamental evil there is either a human element of dishonesty or an animal element of rage.
Think hard about the differences between true murder, combat on the battlefield, and dueling pistols at dawn.
Only the soldier can kill honestly and dispassionately.

Given the construct, where truth is a bedrock of society and morality, how did we ever get to a point in time when women summarily dismissed when they brought up allegations of sexual assault?

Centuries of patriarchy where men took positions of authority in both church and state.

Etiher
1. As individuals we knew the truth and yet we collectively suppressed our conscience, and in effect helped perpetuate the lie in order to maintain good standing in the patriarchal society
2. Our patriarchal culture and our privilege clouded our evolutionary skill to detect the lie.

At its core, the #MeToo movement must undo one or both.
The former is much more damning its appraisal of our patriarchy.  
It makes most of us complicit in the most violent and carnal acts of aggression against the most vulnerable.
I am not here to protest my innocence.
My point is that its not constructive to the feminist cause.

Presumption that someone else knows an unknowable truth

There is a often misattributed quote, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"

One of the probably origins was from the philosopher John Stuart Mill,
"Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing."
This version includes a key turn of phrase, "look on."
The presumption is that evil will be self-evident.
That the truth is plain for all.

Sexual assault is rarely committed in broad daylight, in the public square.
And therefore the presumption that someone else knows the truth is complicated

Alyssa Milano is going through this right now, with regards to accusation against Biden.
The person who kicked off this movement is now herself accused of knowing the truth, but silencing her own conscience for the privileged status she enjoys in the feminist wing of the Democratic Party and her left leaning community in California.
Essentially this becomes an unwinnable purity contest.  
"Believe all Women," fits nicely on a bumper sticker and is clearly in opposition to patriarchal norms.
But its not morally superior to "Believe all Men."
Seeking truth is the high ground in this fight.

Now drop the accusation that the truth in any one circumstance is evident, and look again that the other option:
Our patriarchal culture and our privilege has clouded our evolutionary skill to detect the lie.
Our collective and unconscious bias is partly to blame.
We've already accepted that construct with regards to race.
Institutional racism can exists without conscious racists, and its effects

And in that sense, "Believe all Women" has a definite purpose at an inflection point in time.
It is an opportunity to recalibrate our bullshit detectors.
To acknowledge the role power dynamics often play in sexual assault.
To acknowledge that to combat bias, we should start from a position of believing women.
Initially this may feel like a pendulum swing, but the truth will act as friction.  

Until a day comes when men and women share power and neither should receive weight to their testimony.

But we won't get there by abandoning our evolutionary skillsets.  We need to use them to topple the patriarchy
