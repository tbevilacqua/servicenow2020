I know it may not have been an easy decision to postpone the wedding, but it seems clear with each passing day that it was the right decision.
You both showed some wisdom in pulling the trigger early.
The only thing I can say to you is, don’t postpone the marriage.  
Don’t put your lives on pause for a year.  
Yes, the wedding will be fantastic in 2021.  
Everyone you care about will come together to witness your love and recognize your commitment to each other.
But that doesn't actually change the commitment made in your hearts the day you got engaged.
So act as if.
Act as if the marriage started today.
Honor the contract starting today.  
Not necessarily with a legal certificate, nor the joint checking account.
But in the sense of the vows you have planned.
And the shared lives you envisioned.
If that means nothing will change, great, you're already there.
If that means everything will change, just go for it.
Years from now, when this global crisis has passed, you may find a difficult moment that is personal.
And again you will have to renew the vows to yourselves, without ceremony.
So it's a skill you will need anyway, to make each other truly happy.
Which you both absolutely deserve.
